# Test Strategy – CleanCity

## Objective
To ensure CleanCity’s functionality aligns with its intended user experience, while surfacing intentional flaws as learning opportunities.

## Test Approach
- **Manual testing** for exploratory discovery
- **Automated testing** for regression and key flows
- **Component-based testing** for individual React components

## Testing Levels
- Unit (form validation logic)
- Integration (status update flows)
- System (admin workflows and dashboards)
- Acceptance (from a QA learner’s POV)

## Test Data
- Form inputs with both valid/invalid data
- Mock pickup requests (varying statuses & locations)

## Reporting
- GitHub issues with clear reproduction steps
- Regular status reports on progress and coverage
