## 8. Conclusion & Reflection

- The team displayed a habit of working in siloes, often reaching out only when tasks were completed. This resulted in a predominantly single-opinion test approach, highlighting a leadership style that is more laissez-faire and communication that could benefit from increased collaboration among testers.
- Gaining a thorough understanding of the full Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) and how its various stages contribute to a cohesive, industry-standard QA reporting workflow has been very insightful.
- Time management remains a crucial challenge, especially when balancing testing duties alongside other personal commitments. Greater mindfulness and realistic scheduling are essential for future projects.
- Performing a risk analysis proved invaluable, allowing me to focus on features most critical to gameplay stability, such as scoring and hint logic, rather than spreading efforts too thin.
- Trade-offs were necessary between comprehensive UI testing coverage and deep testing of high-risk, core functional features, given the limited timeframe.
- While adopting Jest for unit and logic testing could have earned bonus points and helped detect subtle bugs beyond the UI layer, time constraints led to deprioritizing this approach.
- Overall, the core functionality of the Word Puzzle Game is working as expected, with all logic-related test cases (scrambling, scoring, hints, input validation) passing successfully.
- However, UI-related bugs remain open and must be addressed prior to production deployment to ensure a polished user experience.
